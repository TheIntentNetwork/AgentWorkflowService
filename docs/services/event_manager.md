# EventManager Class

## Overview
The EventManager class serves as the central hub for event management in the agent workflow system. It coordinates event subscriptions, publications, and processing across different components, enabling decoupled and asynchronous communication throughout the system.

## Key Components

### Attributes
- `service_registry`: ServiceRegistry instance for accessing other services
- `redis`: RedisService instance for Redis operations
- `kafka`: KafkaService instance for Kafka operations
- `queue`: Asynchronous queue for event processing
- `event_loop`: Event loop for asynchronous operations
- `tasks`: List of running tasks
- `eventListeners`: Dictionary to store event listeners
- `notified`: Set to track notified events

### Methods
- `__init__(name: str, service_registry: ServiceRegistry, **kwargs)`: Initializes the EventManager
- `subscribe_to_channels(channels, callback, filter_func=None)`: Subscribes to Redis channels
- `subscribe_to_patterns(patterns, callback, filter_func=None)`: Subscribes to Redis patterns
- `subscribe_to_event_topics(topics)`: Subscribes to Kafka topics
- `notify_subscribers(context_key: str, data: dict = None, caller: str = "Unknown", property_path: str = None)`: Notifies subscribers of updates
- `subscribe_to_updates(node_id: str, property_path: str = None, callback: Callable = None, filter_func: Callable = None)`: Subscribes to updates for a specific node
- `publish_update(channel: str, update_event: dict)`: Publishes an update event to a channel

## Usage
The EventManager is typically instantiated and managed by the ServiceRegistry. Other components in the system can request an instance of the EventManager to subscribe to or publish events.

## Key Features and Functionality
1. **Event Subscription Management**: Supports subscribing to Redis channels, patterns, and Kafka topics.
2. **Asynchronous Event Processing**: Utilizes an asynchronous queue for efficient event handling.
3. **Integration with Multiple Services**: Works with both Redis and Kafka for comprehensive event distribution.
4. **Pattern-based Subscriptions**: Allows flexible subscriptions using patterns for more dynamic event handling.
5. **Targeted Notifications**: Supports notifying subscribers based on specific context keys and property paths.
6. **Filtering Capabilities**: Provides optional filter functions for fine-grained control over event processing.
7. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle a large number of events and subscribers efficiently.

## Interactions
- Interacts closely with RedisService and KafkaService for event distribution
- Used by various components in the system to subscribe to and publish events
- Communicates with the ContextManager for context-related events

## Note
The EventManager is a critical component in maintaining the event-driven architecture of the agent workflow system. It enables loosely coupled components to communicate effectively, supporting complex workflows and real-time updates across the system.
