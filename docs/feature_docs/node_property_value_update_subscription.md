# Node Property Value Update Subscription

The Node Property Value Update Subscription feature allows system components to subscribe to and receive notifications about changes in specific property values of nodes.

## Key Functions

1. **Subscription Registration**
   - Implements a method in the Node class to allow other components to subscribe to specific property value changes
   - Maintains a list of subscribers for each node's properties

2. **Property Change Detection**
   - Implements mechanisms within nodes to detect and report property value changes
   - Ensures that all relevant property changes are captured and reported

3. **Context Manager Integration**
   - Utilizes the Context Manager to track and manage property value changes
   - Registers property value update events with the Context Manager

4. **Callback Registration**
   - Allows subscribers to register callbacks for specific property value updates
   - Supports filtering of property updates based on specific criteria (e.g., value thresholds)

5. **Notification Dispatch**
   - Implements a notification system in the Context Manager to trigger registered callbacks
   - Ensures efficient and timely delivery of property value update notifications

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implements error handling mechanisms for failed notifications or callback executions
   - Provides retry mechanisms for failed notification deliveries

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimizes the subscription and notification process to handle a large number of properties and subscribers
   - Implements batching of notifications when appropriate to reduce system load

8. **Subscription Management**
   - Provides methods for subscribers to manage their subscriptions (e.g., unsubscribe, modify filters)
   - Implements cleanup of stale subscriptions to prevent resource leaks

9. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Logs all significant property value update operations for auditing and debugging purposes
   - Provides monitoring capabilities to track the health and performance of the property update system

10. **Security and Access Control**
    - Implements security measures to ensure only authorized components can subscribe to property value updates
    - Manages access control for sensitive property information

11. **Historical Property Tracking**
    - Optionally maintains a history of property value changes for each node
    - Provides mechanisms to query historical property data

12. **Differential Updates**
    - Implements mechanisms to send only the changes in property values rather than the entire property state
    - Optimizes network usage and processing for large property structures

Implementation of these functions will enable efficient and reliable distribution of node property value updates throughout the system, allowing components to react promptly to changes in node properties and maintain an up-to-date view of the system's state.
