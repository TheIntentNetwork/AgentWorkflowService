# Lifecycle Node

The Lifecycle Node represents a node in the workflow, manages its own lifecycle (initialization, execution, etc.), and interacts with other nodes and the Universal Agent.

## Key Functions

1. **Initialization**
   - Sets up the node's initial state and configuration
   - Establishes connections with the Universal Agent and other necessary services

2. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Identifies and resolves dependencies required for the node's operation
   - Communicates with other nodes or services to ensure all prerequisites are met

3. **Execution**
   - Performs the node's primary function or task
   - Processes inputs and generates outputs

4. **State Management**
   - Maintains and updates the node's internal state
   - Reports state changes to the Universal Agent and other subscribed entities

5. **Event Handling**
   - Listens for and responds to relevant events in the system
   - Triggers appropriate actions based on received events

6. **Output Publication**
   - Publishes the results of its operations for other nodes or the Universal Agent to consume

7. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Detects and handles errors that occur during its operation
   - Implements recovery procedures or notifies the Universal Agent of unrecoverable errors

8. **Lifecycle Transitions**
   - Manages transitions between different lifecycle stages (e.g., initialized, running, completed, error)
   - Ensures proper cleanup and resource release when transitioning to a terminated state

9. **Interaction with Universal Agent**
   - Regularly communicates with the Universal Agent to report status and receive instructions
   - Requests resources or assistance from the Universal Agent when needed

10. **Logging and Monitoring**
    - Maintains detailed logs of its operations and state changes
    - Provides monitoring endpoints for health checks and performance metrics

Implementation of these functions will enable the Lifecycle Node to effectively manage its own operations while integrating smoothly with the broader agent ecosystem.
