# Universe Agent

The Universe Agent is responsible for managing the overall system state, coordinating between different nodes, and handling high-level decision making.

## Key Functions

1. **System State Management**
   - Maintains a global view of the system's current state
   - Tracks the status and progress of all active nodes and processes

2. **Node Coordination**
   - Facilitates communication between different nodes
   - Manages dependencies between nodes
   - Ensures proper sequencing of node operations

3. **High-Level Decision Making**
   - Analyzes system state and node outputs to make strategic decisions
   - Determines when to spawn new processes or terminate existing ones
   - Adjusts system behavior based on overall goals and current conditions

4. **Goal Management**
   - Maintains a list of high-level system goals
   - Breaks down goals into actionable tasks for nodes
   - Monitors goal progress and adjusts strategies as needed

5. **Resource Allocation**
   - Manages system resources and allocates them to nodes as needed
   - Balances workload across available resources for optimal performance

6. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Detects and responds to system-wide errors or failures
   - Implements recovery strategies to maintain system stability

7. **System Monitoring and Logging**
   - Continuously monitors system performance and health
   - Logs important events and decisions for analysis and debugging

8. **API and Interface Management**
   - Provides interfaces for external systems to interact with the agent ecosystem
   - Manages API requests and responses

Implementation of these functions will allow the Universe Agent to effectively manage and coordinate the entire agent ecosystem, ensuring efficient operation and goal achievement.
