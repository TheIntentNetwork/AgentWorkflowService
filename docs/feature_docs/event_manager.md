# Event Manager

The Event Manager is responsible for managing events in the system and handling event subscriptions and notifications.

## Key Functions

1. **Event Registration**
   - Allows system components to register new event types
   - Maintains a registry of all available event types in the system

2. **Event Publication**
   - Provides mechanisms for system components to publish events
   - Ensures efficient distribution of events to all relevant subscribers

3. **Event Subscription**
   - Allows system components to subscribe to specific event types
   - Manages a list of subscribers for each event type

4. **Notification Dispatch**
   - Notifies subscribers when events they're subscribed to occur
   - Implements efficient notification mechanisms to handle high-volume events

5. **Filtering and Routing**
   - Supports event filtering based on various criteria
   - Routes events to appropriate subscribers based on subscription rules

6. **Status Update Subscription**
   - Specifically handles subscriptions for node status updates
   - Notifies subscribers when node statuses change

7. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Implements asynchronous event processing to prevent blocking operations
   - Manages event queues and ensures proper order of event processing

8. **Error Handling**
   - Implements robust error handling for event processing and notification
   - Provides mechanisms for subscribers to handle and recover from errors

9. **Event Persistence**
   - Optionally persists events for reliability and auditing purposes
   - Provides mechanisms to replay events if needed

10. **Performance Optimization**
    - Implements optimizations to handle high volumes of events efficiently
    - Provides mechanisms to prevent event flooding and ensure system stability

11. **Monitoring and Logging**
    - Logs all significant event operations for auditing and debugging purposes
    - Provides monitoring capabilities for system health and performance related to event management

12. **Event Transformation**
    - Supports transformation of events between different formats or structures
    - Allows for event enrichment with additional context before delivery to subscribers

13. **Security and Access Control**
    - Implements security measures to prevent unauthorized event publications or subscriptions
    - Manages access control for sensitive events

Implementation of these functions will enable the Event Manager to effectively handle the flow of events throughout the agent ecosystem, ensuring that all components can react to system changes and communicate efficiently.
