# Context Manager

The Context Manager is responsible for managing the context data for nodes, handling updates and retrievals of context information.

## Key Functions

1. **Context Storage**
   - Stores context data for each node in the system
   - Maintains a structured representation of context information

2. **Context Retrieval**
   - Provides methods to retrieve context data for specific nodes
   - Supports querying of context data based on various parameters

3. **Context Updates**
   - Handles updates to context data from nodes and other system components
   - Ensures atomic updates to maintain data consistency

4. **Property Value Subscription**
   - Allows nodes to subscribe to specific property value changes within contexts
   - Manages a list of subscribers for each context property

5. **Notification System**
   - Notifies subscribers when subscribed property values change
   - Implements efficient notification mechanisms to handle high-volume updates

6. **Versioning and History**
   - Maintains a history of context changes
   - Provides the ability to retrieve previous versions of context data

7. **Context Validation**
   - Validates context updates to ensure they conform to predefined schemas or rules
   - Rejects invalid updates and notifies the sender

8. **Context Serialization and Deserialization**
   - Serializes context data for storage or transmission
   - Deserializes context data when retrieving from storage or receiving updates

9. **Access Control**
   - Implements access control mechanisms to ensure nodes can only access and modify authorized contexts
   - Manages permissions for context access and modification

10. **Context Cleanup**
    - Implements mechanisms to clean up or archive old or unused context data
    - Manages the lifecycle of context data in the system

11. **Performance Optimization**
    - Implements caching mechanisms for frequently accessed context data
    - Optimizes storage and retrieval operations for large-scale systems

12. **Logging and Monitoring**
    - Logs all significant context operations for auditing and debugging purposes
    - Provides monitoring capabilities for system health and performance related to context management

Implementation of these functions will enable the Context Manager to effectively manage and distribute context information throughout the agent ecosystem, ensuring that all nodes have access to the data they need for their operations.
