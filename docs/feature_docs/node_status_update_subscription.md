# Node Status Update Subscription

The Node Status Update Subscription feature allows system components to subscribe to and receive notifications about changes in node statuses.

## Key Functions

1. **Subscription Registration**
   - Implements a method in the Node class to allow other components to subscribe to its status updates
   - Maintains a list of subscribers for each node's status

2. **Status Change Detection**
   - Implements mechanisms within nodes to detect and report status changes
   - Ensures that all relevant status changes are captured and reported

3. **Event Manager Integration**
   - Utilizes the Event Manager to handle the distribution of status update events
   - Registers status update events with the Event Manager

4. **Callback Registration**
   - Allows subscribers to register callbacks for specific status changes
   - Supports filtering of status updates based on specific criteria

5. **Notification Dispatch**
   - Implements a notification system in the Event Manager to trigger registered callbacks
   - Ensures efficient and timely delivery of status update notifications

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implements error handling mechanisms for failed notifications or callback executions
   - Provides retry mechanisms for failed notification deliveries

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimizes the subscription and notification process to handle a large number of nodes and subscribers
   - Implements batching of notifications when appropriate to reduce system load

8. **Subscription Management**
   - Provides methods for subscribers to manage their subscriptions (e.g., unsubscribe, modify filters)
   - Implements cleanup of stale subscriptions to prevent resource leaks

9. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Logs all significant status update operations for auditing and debugging purposes
   - Provides monitoring capabilities to track the health and performance of the status update system

10. **Security and Access Control**
    - Implements security measures to ensure only authorized components can subscribe to status updates
    - Manages access control for sensitive status information

11. **Historical Status Tracking**
    - Optionally maintains a history of status changes for each node
    - Provides mechanisms to query historical status data

Implementation of these functions will enable efficient and reliable distribution of node status updates throughout the system, allowing components to react promptly to changes in node states and maintain an up-to-date view of the system's overall status.
