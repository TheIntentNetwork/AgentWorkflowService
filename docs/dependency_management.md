# Dependency Management in Node and Model

This document outlines the process utilized by Node and Model classes to manage dependencies, create them, and handle notifications for value updates. It's important to note that Model is a subclass of Node, inheriting most of its dependency management functionality.

## 1. Node Class: Core Dependency Management

The Node class serves as the foundation for dependency management in the system. Both Node and its subclass Model use these core functionalities.

### 1.1 Dependency Discovery and Registration

#### Node Initialization
- During node initialization, the `initialize()` method is called.
- This method invokes `_set_context()` and then calls `discover_and_register_dependencies()` from the DependencyService.

#### Dependency Discovery
- The DependencyService uses a UniverseAgent to analyze the node's input description and context.
- It uses the RetrieveContext tool to find relevant outputs from other nodes that can satisfy the required dependencies.

#### Dependency Registration
- Discovered dependencies are registered using the RegisterDependencies tool.
- Each dependency is added to the node's dependencies list using the `add_dependency()` method.
- The node subscribes to updates for each dependency using `subscribe_to_dependency()`.

### 1.2 Dependency Updates and Notifications

#### Handling Dependency Updates
- The DependencyService's `on_dependency_update()` method is called when a dependency update is received.
- This method updates the dependency's value and checks if it's now met.

#### Resolving Dependencies
- If all dependencies for a node are met, `on_all_dependencies_resolved()` is called.
- This method updates the node's status to "ready" using the ContextManager.

### 1.3 Executing Nodes with Resolved Dependencies

#### Checking Dependency Status
- Before a node executes, it checks if all its dependencies are met using `dependencies_met()`.

#### Node Execution
- If all dependencies are met, the node proceeds with its execution.
- The node can access the values of its dependencies through the ContextManager.

### 1.4 Cleaning Up Dependencies

#### Removing Dependencies
- Dependencies can be removed using the `remove_dependency()` method.
- This also unsubscribes the node from updates for that dependency.

#### Clearing All Dependencies
- All dependencies for a node can be cleared using the `clear_dependencies()` method.
- This is useful when reinitializing a node or cleaning up resources.

## 2. Model Class: Extending Node Functionality

The Model class, being a subclass of Node, inherits all the dependency management functionality described above. However, it does have some specific behaviors related to its role in the system.

### 2.1 Model Initialization
- When a model is initialized, it calls the `_build_agency_chart()` method.
- This method creates a UniverseAgent with specific instructions to assess the task and find appropriate agents.

### 2.2 Model-Specific Execution
- The Model class overrides the `execute()` method to include additional steps:
  - It executes its own logic (inherited from Node).
  - After its own execution, it iterates through its collection of child nodes and executes them.

### 2.3 Dependency Management for Child Nodes
- When clearing dependencies, the Model class not only clears its own dependencies but also recursively clears dependencies for all its child nodes.

## 3. Conclusion

The dependency management system is primarily implemented in the Node class, with the Model class inheriting and slightly extending this functionality. This design allows for a consistent approach to dependency handling across different types of nodes in the system, while still allowing for specialized behavior in Models when necessary.

By following this process, the system ensures that both Nodes and Models have access to the required context from other nodes, and that they are notified of any relevant updates. This allows for efficient and dynamic execution of complex workflows, whether dealing with individual nodes or more complex model structures.
