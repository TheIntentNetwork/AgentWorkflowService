# Lifecycle Manager Workflow

## Initialization Process

1. **Application Startup**
   - The main application (`main.py`) initializes core services, including the LifecycleManager.

2. **LifecycleManager Initialization**
   - The `LifecycleManager.initialize()` method is called during application startup.
   - It uses a distributed lock (via Redis) to ensure only one instance performs the initialization.

3. **Creating Lifecycle Nodes**
   - The `create_lifecycle_nodes()` method is called within the initialization process.
   - It retrieves predefined static lifecycle nodes using `get_static_lifecycle_nodes()`.
   - Each lifecycle node is created and started using `start_lifecycle_node()`.

4. **Subscribing to Status Updates**
   - After creating nodes, the manager subscribes to node status updates via the EventManager.

## Retrieving Lifecycle Methods/Nodes

1. **Context Storage**
   - Lifecycle nodes and their methods are stored in the ContextManager (backed by Redis).

2. **Retrieval Process**
   - When a new node is created and needs to be processed:
     a. The ExecutionService is responsible for managing the node's lifecycle.
     b. It retrieves the appropriate lifecycle methods/nodes from the ContextManager.

3. **Applying Lifecycle Methods**
   - The ExecutionService applies the retrieved lifecycle methods to the new node:
     a. `set_context`: Sets up the initial context for the node.
     b. `register_outputs`: Defines the expected outputs of the node.
     c. `get_dependencies`: Determines what other nodes this node depends on.
     d. `execute`: Performs the actual execution of the node.

## Workflow for Processing New Nodes

1. **Node Creation**
   - A new node is created, typically as part of a larger workflow or task.

2. **Lifecycle Application**
   - The ExecutionService retrieves the lifecycle nodes/methods from the ContextManager.
   - It applies each lifecycle method in sequence:
     a. Initialize the node's context.
     b. Register the node's expected outputs.
     c. Determine and set up the node's dependencies.
     d. Execute the node's main functionality.
     e. Finalize the node's execution and clean up.

3. **Status Updates**
   - Throughout this process, status updates are sent via the EventManager.
   - The LifecycleManager, subscribed to these updates, can monitor and manage the overall system state.

## Key Components Interaction

- **LifecycleManager**: Initializes and manages the overall lifecycle system.
- **ExecutionService**: Applies lifecycle methods to individual nodes.
- **ContextManager**: Stores and retrieves lifecycle nodes and their associated data.
- **EventManager**: Facilitates communication of status updates and other events.

This workflow ensures that all nodes in the system follow a consistent lifecycle, managed centrally but applied individually, allowing for scalable and maintainable node processing.
