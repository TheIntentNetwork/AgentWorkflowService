# Features

## Universal Agent
- Manages the overall system state
- Coordinates between different nodes
- Handles high-level decision making

## Lifecycle Node
- Represents a node in the workflow
- Manages its own lifecycle (initialization, execution, etc.)
- Interacts with other nodes and the Universal Agent

## Context Manager
- Manages the context data for nodes
- Handles updates and retrievals of context information

## Event Manager
- Manages events in the system
- Handles event subscriptions and notifications

## Node Status Update Subscription
1. Implement a method in the Node class to subscribe to status updates
2. Use the EventManager to handle status update events
3. Allow nodes to register callbacks for specific status changes
4. Implement a notification system in the EventManager to trigger callbacks

## Node Property Value Update Subscription
1. Implement a method in the Node class to subscribe to specific property value changes
2. Use the ContextManager to track property value changes
3. Allow nodes to register callbacks for specific property value updates
4. Implement a notification system in the ContextManager to trigger callbacks

## Subscription Process
1. Node A wants to subscribe to Node B's status or property updates
2. Node A calls the appropriate subscription method on Node B
3. Node B registers the subscription with the EventManager or ContextManager
4. When a status or property change occurs in Node B, it notifies the appropriate manager
5. The manager checks for subscriptions and triggers the registered callbacks

## Implementation Steps
1. Update the Node class to include subscription methods
2. Enhance the EventManager to handle status update subscriptions
3. Enhance the ContextManager to handle property value update subscriptions
4. Implement notification methods in both managers to trigger callbacks
5. Update the UniversalAgent to coordinate the subscription process when necessary
6. Add error handling and logging for the subscription and notification processes
