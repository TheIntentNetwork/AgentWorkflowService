# Context Manager Requirements

## Overview
The context manager is a crucial component for managing the state and context of nodes within our lifecycle and memory management system. This document outlines the requirements and functionalities necessary for the context manager to support the features described in our lifecycle and memory management plan.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. In-Memory Data Management
- **Store Object Properties**: The context manager should be able to store properties of objects in memory.
- **State Updates**: It should handle state updates for objects efficiently.
- **Logging**: The context manager should log state changes and updates.

### 2. Context Creation and Updates
- **Object Creation**: The context manager should support the creation of new objects with initial context.
- **Context Updates**: It should allow updating the context of existing objects.
- **Efficient Access**: The context manager should provide efficient access to object properties and context.

### 3. Redis Integration for Pub/Sub
- **Setup Redis**: The context manager should integrate with Redis for Pub/Sub functionality.
- **Subscription Management**: It should manage subscriptions for object state changes and lifecycle events.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: The context manager should handle real-time notifications for state changes.

### 4. Path-Based Access and Notifications
- **Path Mapping**: The context manager should support mapping hierarchical paths to object properties.
- **Path-Based Updates**: It should allow updates to object properties using hierarchical paths.
- **Notification System**: The context manager should notify subscribers based on path-based changes.

### 5. Update Logging
- **Log Mechanism**: The context manager should log updates and state changes.
- **Granularity Control**: It should provide options to control the granularity of logged events.

### 6. Batch Processing and Replay
- **Batch Processing**: The context manager should support processing updates in batches.
- **Replay Mechanism**: It should allow replaying state changes from the log to reconstruct object states.

### 7. Lifecycle Event Handling
- **State Update Mechanism**: The context manager should handle state updates for each lifecycle event.
- **Pause and Resume**: It should support pausing and resuming the processing of lifecycle events.

### 8. Testing and Integration
- **Integration Testing**: The context manager should be thoroughly tested for integration with Redis and in-memory data management.
- **Performance Testing**: It should be tested under load to ensure it can handle real-time updates and batch processing efficiently.

## Summary
The context manager is essential for managing the state and context of nodes within our system. By fulfilling these requirements, the context manager will ensure efficient state management, real-time notifications, and reliable logging and replay mechanisms, supporting the overall lifecycle and memory management plan.
