# Seed Context Index Documentation

## Purpose
The `seed_context_index.py` script is responsible for creating test data for intent and workflow indexes and storing them in Redis. It also creates the indexes for the intent and workflow data in Redisearch.

## Functionality
1. Connects to Redis and creates necessary indexes.
2. Defines schemas for context and workflow indexes.
3. Generates embeddings for test data using a Hugging Face text vectorizer.
4. Stores the test data along with their embeddings in Redis.
5. Provides utility functions for preprocessing text and generating embeddings.
6. Includes a main function to create indexes and store test data.

## Key Components
- Redis connection setup
- Index schema definitions
- Text preprocessing and embedding generation
- Test data creation and storage
- Asynchronous functions for creating indexes and querying the vector database

## Usage
The script is designed to be run as a standalone Python script:
```
python seed_context_index.py
```

## Dependencies
- Redis
- Hugging Face Hub
- NumPy
- Pydantic
- Custom logging configuration

## Note
This script is crucial for initializing the database with test data and setting up the necessary indexes for efficient querying in the agent workflow service.
