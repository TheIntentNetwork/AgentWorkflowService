# Dependency Model

## Overview
The Dependency model represents the relationships and dependencies between different nodes in the agent workflow system. It defines how outputs from one step or node can be used as inputs for another.

## Key Components

### Base Class: BaseDependency
- Attributes:
  - `context_key`: The key in the context where the dependency data is stored
  - `property_name`: The specific property of the context that this dependency relates to

- Methods:
  - `update_subscription(message: dict)`: Abstract method to update the subscription based on received messages
  - `on_dependency_satisfied(message: dict, dependent_step_id: str)`: Callback method when the dependency condition is met
  - `subscribe_to_dependency(step_output_key: str, dependent_step_id: str)`: Subscribes to a Redis channel for dependency updates
  - `on_message_received(message: dict, dependent_step_id: str)`: Handles messages received from Redis
  - `to_dict() -> dict`: Converts the dependency to a dictionary representation

### Subclasses
1. OneToOneDependency
   - Represents a one-to-one dependency between two steps
   - Each output of the first step is processed by the second step

2. OneRunDependency
   - Represents a one-run dependency between two steps
   - The second step processes the output of the first step only once

3. Dependency
   - A concrete implementation of BaseDependency
   - Additional attribute: `output`: Stores the output of the dependency

## Usage
Dependencies are used to define the relationships between different nodes or steps in a workflow. They ensure that data flows correctly between steps and that steps are executed in the proper order based on their dependencies.

## Interactions
- Used by Node and Task models to manage dependencies between steps
- Interacts with the Redis service for pub/sub functionality
- May be used by the workflow engine to determine execution order

## Note
The Dependency model provides a flexible way to define various types of dependencies in the workflow system. It can be extended to support more complex dependency scenarios as needed.
