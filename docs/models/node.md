# Node Model

## Overview
The Node model represents an individual step or action within a task in the agent workflow system. It encapsulates the properties and behaviors of the smallest unit of work that can be executed.

## Key Components

### Attributes
- `id`: Unique identifier for the node
- `name`: Name of the node
- `description`: Brief description of the node's purpose
- `status`: Current status of the node (e.g., pending, in progress, completed)
- `events`: List of events associated with the node
- `dependencies`: List of IDs of other nodes that this node depends on

### Methods
- `update_status(new_status)`: Updates the status of the node
- `add_event(event)`: Adds a new event to the node
- `add_dependency(dependency_id)`: Adds a dependency to the node
- `get_status()`: Returns the current status of the node
- `get_dependencies()`: Returns the list of dependencies for the node

## Usage
Nodes are the building blocks of tasks within the agent workflow system. They represent individual actions or steps that need to be performed as part of a larger task.

## Interactions
- Contained within Task objects
- May have dependencies on other Nodes within the same Task
- Interacts with Agent objects during execution
- Managed by the Task and Agency for status updates and execution flow

## Note
The Node model allows for fine-grained control and monitoring of task execution. It can be extended to include additional properties or methods specific to certain types of actions or workflow requirements.
