# Agent Model

## Overview
The Agent model represents the core entity in our agent workflow system. It encapsulates the behavior and properties of an intelligent agent capable of performing tasks and interacting within the workflow.

## Key Components

### Attributes
- `id`: Unique identifier for the agent
- `name`: Name of the agent
- `description`: Brief description of the agent's purpose
- `capabilities`: List of capabilities the agent possesses
- `state`: Current state of the agent (e.g., idle, working, completed)

### Methods
- `perform_task(task)`: Executes a given task
- `update_state(new_state)`: Updates the agent's current state
- `get_capabilities()`: Returns the list of agent capabilities

## Usage
Agents are instantiated and managed by the Agency class. They can be assigned tasks, queried for their current state, and updated as the workflow progresses.

## Interactions
- Interacts with Task objects to perform assigned work
- Communicates with the Agency for task assignment and status updates
- May interact with other Agents in collaborative scenarios

## Note
The Agent model is extensible and can be subclassed to create specialized agent types with additional properties or behaviors specific to certain workflow requirements.
