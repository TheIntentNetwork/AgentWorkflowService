# Task Model

## Overview
The Task model represents a unit of work within the agent workflow system. It encapsulates the properties and behaviors of tasks that can be assigned to agents for execution.

## Key Components

### Attributes
- `key`: The key of the task (str)
- `id`: Unique identifier for the task (Optional[str])
- `node_template_name`: The name of the task template (Optional[str])
- `name`: Name of the task (Optional[str])
- `description`: Brief description of the task's purpose (str)
- `assignees`: List of agents involved in the task (List[str])
- `status`: Current status of the task (Literal[None, "pending", "in-progress", "completed", "failed"])
- `session_id`: ID of the session associated with the task (Optional[str])
- `context_info`: Context information for the task (ContextInfo)

### Methods
- `create(**task_data)`: Class method to create a new Task instance
- `handle(key, action, object_data, context)`: Class method to handle task actions
- `process_action(action)`: Processes different actions on the task
- `initialize()`: Initializes the task
- `execute()`: Executes the task
- `to_dict()`: Converts the Task instance to a dictionary

## Usage
Tasks are created and managed within the workflow system. They represent the work to be done and are executed by agents.

## Interactions
- Interacts with Agent objects during execution
- Managed by the workflow system for task creation, assignment, and monitoring
- Uses ContextInfo for maintaining task context
- Interacts with various services like ContextManager, NodeContextManager, and AgentFactory

## Note
The Task model is designed to be flexible and can accommodate various types of work within the agent workflow system. It includes methods for initialization, execution, and context management, making it a central component in the workflow process.
