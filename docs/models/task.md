# Task Model

## Overview
The Task model represents a unit of work within the agent workflow system. It encapsulates the properties and behaviors of tasks that can be assigned to agents for execution.

## Key Components

### Attributes
- `id`: Unique identifier for the task
- `name`: Name of the task
- `description`: Brief description of the task's purpose
- `nodes`: List of nodes that make up the task
- `dependencies`: List of IDs of tasks that this task depends on
- `status`: Current status of the task (e.g., pending, in progress, completed)
- `events`: List of events associated with the task

### Methods
- `add_node(node)`: Adds a new node to the task
- `add_dependency(dependency_id)`: Adds a dependency to the task
- `update_status(new_status)`: Updates the status of the task
- `add_event(event)`: Adds a new event to the task
- `get_status()`: Returns the current status of the task
- `get_dependencies()`: Returns the list of dependencies for the task

## Usage
Tasks are created and managed by the Agency class. They represent the work to be done within the workflow system and are assigned to agents for execution.

## Interactions
- Interacts with Agent objects when assigned for execution
- Managed by the Agency for task creation, assignment, and monitoring
- Contains Node objects that represent individual steps or actions within the task

## Note
The Task model is designed to be flexible and can accommodate various types of work within the agent workflow system. It can be extended or customized to fit specific workflow requirements.
