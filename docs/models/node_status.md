# NodeStatus Enum

## Overview
The NodeStatus enum represents the various states a node can be in during its lifecycle within the agent workflow system. It provides a standardized set of status values that can be used to track and manage the progress of nodes through the workflow.

## Enum Values
- `created`: The node has been created but not yet initialized
- `pending`: The node is waiting to be processed
- `pre_initializing`: The node is about to start initialization
- `initializing`: The node is in the process of being initialized
- `initialized`: The node has completed initialization
- `resolving_dependencies`: The node is resolving its dependencies
- `dependencies_resolved`: All dependencies for the node have been resolved
- `ready`: The node is ready for execution
- `assigning`: The node is in the process of being assigned for execution
- `assigned`: The node has been assigned and is waiting to start execution
- `pre_execute`: The node is preparing for execution
- `executing`: The node is currently executing
- `monitoring`: The node is being monitored during execution
- `completed`: The node has completed execution successfully
- `failed`: The node has failed during execution
- `no_action`: No action is required for this node

## Usage
The NodeStatus enum is used throughout the agent workflow system to:
- Track the current state of nodes
- Determine which nodes are ready for execution
- Manage the flow of the workflow based on node statuses
- Provide status updates to users or monitoring systems

## Interactions
- Used by the Node model to represent its current status
- Utilized by the workflow engine to manage node execution
- May be used in reporting and monitoring tools to provide workflow status information

## Note
The NodeStatus enum provides a comprehensive set of statuses to cover the entire lifecycle of a node in the workflow system. It can be extended with additional statuses if more granular state tracking is required in the future.
