# Approaches to Fix Event Loop Issue

## Overview
This document outlines various approaches to address the issues related to the premature closure of the event loop and the `KeyError` encountered during the execution of `new_test_event_property_updates.py`.

## Issue Summary
1. **KeyError**: The `KeyError` occurs when accessing `context_data['subcontext']['subkey1']` because the `subcontext` key is missing.
2. **RuntimeError**: The `RuntimeError` occurs due to the event loop being closed prematurely, causing issues with Redis and Kafka client closures.

## Approaches to Fix the Issues

### Approach 1: Ensure Proper Context Data Structure
Ensure that the context data structure is correctly updated and accessed. This involves verifying the structure before making assertions.

#### Steps:
1. Verify the existence of keys before accessing them.
2. Use default values or create missing keys if necessary.

### Approach 2: Graceful Shutdown of Event Loop
Ensure the event loop is not closed prematurely and handle the `KeyboardInterrupt` more gracefully.

#### Steps:
1. Check if the event loop is running before stopping it.
2. Ensure all asynchronous tasks are completed before closing the event loop.

### Approach 3: Properly Handle Redis and Kafka Client Closures
Ensure that Redis and Kafka clients are properly closed before the event loop is stopped.

#### Steps:
1. Close Redis and Kafka clients in a `finally` block to ensure they are closed even if an exception occurs.
2. Use `await` to ensure the clients are fully closed before stopping the event loop.

## Detailed Implementation

### Step 1: Ensure Proper Context Data Structure

```python
# Verify the existence of keys before accessing them
assert 'context_info' in context_data
assert 'context' in context_data['context_info']
assert 'test_key1' in context_data['context_info']['context']
assert context_data['context_info']['context']['test_key1'] == "test_value1"
assert 'test_key2' in context_data['context_info']['context']
assert context_data['context_info']['context']['test_key2'] == "test_value2"
assert 'subcontext' in context_data['context_info']['context']
assert 'subkey1' in context_data['context_info']['context']['subcontext']
assert context_data['context_info']['context']['subcontext']['subkey1'] == "subvalue1"
assert 'subkey2' in context_data['context_info']['context']['subcontext']
assert context_data['context_info']['context']['subcontext']['subkey2'] == "subvalue2"
```

### Step 2: Graceful Shutdown of Event Loop

```python
# Check if the event loop is running before stopping it
if loop.is_running():
    loop.stop()
```

### Step 3: Properly Handle Redis and Kafka Client Closures

```python
# Close Redis and Kafka clients in a finally block
if kafka_service:
    await kafka_service.close()
if redis_service:
    await redis_service.client.aclose()
# Stop the event loop gracefully
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
if loop.is_running():
    loop.stop()
```

## Changes Implemented

### Step 1: Ensure Proper Context Data Structure

Updated the `new_test_event_property_updates.py` file to verify the existence of keys before accessing them.

```python
# Verify the existence of keys before accessing them
assert 'context_info' in context_data
assert 'context' in context_data['context_info']
assert 'test_key1' in context_data['context_info']['context']
assert context_data['context_info']['context']['test_key1'] == "test_value1"
assert 'test_key2' in context_data['context_info']['context']
assert context_data['context_info']['context']['test_key2'] == "test_value2"
assert 'subcontext' in context_data['context_info']['context']
assert 'subkey1' in context_data['context_info']['context']['subcontext']
assert context_data['context_info']['context']['subcontext']['subkey1'] == "subvalue1"
assert 'subkey2' in context_data['context_info']['context']['subcontext']
assert context_data['context_info']['context']['subcontext']['subkey2'] == "subvalue2"
```

### Step 2: Graceful Shutdown of Event Loop

Updated the `new_test_event_property_updates.py` file to check if the event loop is running before stopping it.

```python
# Check if the event loop is running before stopping it
if loop.is_running():
    loop.stop()
```

### Step 3: Properly Handle Redis and Kafka Client Closures

Updated the `new_test_event_property_updates.py` file to close Redis and Kafka clients in a `finally` block.

```python
# Close Redis and Kafka clients in a finally block
if kafka_service:
    await kafka_service.close()
if redis_service:
    await redis_service.client.aclose()
# Stop the event loop gracefully
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
if loop.is_running():
    loop.stop()
```

## Reasons for Failure
1. **Event Loop Closed Prematurely**: The event loop was closed before the Redis and Kafka clients were fully closed, leading to a `RuntimeError`.
2. **Redis Client Disconnection**: The Redis client attempted to disconnect after the event loop was already closed, causing an additional `RuntimeError`.
3. **Kafka Client Wakeup Socket**: The Kafka client encountered issues sending to the wakeup socket, likely due to the event loop being closed prematurely.

## New Approaches
1. **Ensure Proper Order of Shutdown**: Ensure that the Redis and Kafka clients are fully closed before stopping the event loop.
2. **Use `run_until_complete` for Client Closures**: Use `loop.run_until_complete` to ensure that the Redis and Kafka clients are fully closed before stopping the event loop.
3. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully**: Add more robust exception handling to ensure that the event loop is not closed prematurely and that all resources are properly cleaned up.

## Updated Implementation Plan
1. **Ensure Proper Order of Shutdown**:
   - Close Redis and Kafka clients before stopping the event loop.
2. **Use `run_until_complete` for Client Closures**:
   - Use `loop.run_until_complete` to ensure that the Redis and Kafka clients are fully closed before stopping the event loop.
3. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully**:
   - Add more robust exception handling to ensure that the event loop is not closed prematurely and that all resources are properly cleaned up.

## Summary
Implementing these updated approaches will ensure that the context data structure is correctly updated and accessed, the event loop is not closed prematurely, and Redis and Kafka clients are properly closed. This will help in resolving the `KeyError` and `RuntimeError` issues encountered during the execution of `new_test_event_property_updates.py`.
