# Code Improvements Tracking Document

## Task Processing System Improvements

### TaskExpansion Class
1. Add explicit handling for different output_format types:
   - 'merge' format handling
   - 'separate' format handling
   - Add validation for format type

2. Enhance template variable replacement:
   - Add support for nested object path notation (e.g. 'condition.condition_name')
   - Improve error handling for missing nested properties
   - Add validation for template syntax

### AgencyTaskGroup Class
1. Add explicit task group level dependency checking:
   - Track dependencies between task groups
   - Validate task group execution order
   - Handle cross-task-group context sharing

### TaskGroup Class
1. Improve dependency validation:
   - Add more detailed error messages
   - Track dependency resolution timing
   - Handle optional dependencies

### TaskProcessor Class
1. Enhance result handling:
   - Better validation of task outputs
   - Improved error handling for failed tasks
   - Support for partial results

## Questions for Further Investigation

1. How should we handle timeout scenarios for expanded tasks?
2. What's the best way to handle partial results in array expansion?
3. Should we implement retry logic for failed expansions?
4. How can we improve error reporting for template variable issues?

## Future Considerations

1. Performance optimization for large array expansions
2. Better monitoring and logging of expansion process
3. Recovery mechanisms for failed expansions
4. Cleanup procedures for partial results

## Notes

This document tracks potential improvements identified during the code review process.
Updates should be made only after thorough testing and validation of current implementation.

## System Health Monitoring Improvements

### 1. Metrics Collection System
- Implement dedicated metrics collection service
- Add structured metrics data models
- Support for different metric types (counters, gauges, histograms)
- Configurable metric retention policies

### 2. Enhanced Error Metrics
- Add detailed error rate tracking
- Implement error categorization system
- Track error recovery success rates
- Measure average recovery times
- Monitor error patterns and trends

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Track task execution times
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Measure Redis operation latency
- Track message processing delays
- Monitor context synchronization times

### 4. Health Check System
- Implement system component health checks
- Add dependency availability monitoring
- Create service status endpoints
- Support for custom health check rules

### 5. Monitoring Dashboard
- Create real-time metrics visualization
- Add historical metrics analysis
- Support for metrics aggregation
- Configurable alerting rules
- Custom dashboard layouts

### 6. Alerting System
- Define alert thresholds
- Support multiple notification channels
- Add alert severity levels
- Implement alert aggregation
- Create alert response workflows

### Implementation Priority
1. Metrics Collection System (High)
2. Enhanced Error Metrics (High)
3. Performance Metrics (Medium)
4. Health Check System (Medium)
5. Monitoring Dashboard (Low)
6. Alerting System (Low)

These improvements should be implemented incrementally to maintain system stability.
