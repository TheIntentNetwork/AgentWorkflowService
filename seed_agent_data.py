            Write a Nexus Letter for a veteran seeking approval for a disability rating. Read customer communication/email from the <|Customer Intake|> above.
            Use the following formatting criteria:
            1.) Research the Sample Nexus Letters that you've been provided within your files to ensure that you understand the format and the content that is required as examples only. 
            2.) Work with the BrowsingAgent to find 2 supporting scientific studies by evaluating the research suggestions.
            3.) Include up to 2 supporting scientific studies if applicable to support the connection between the condition and the veteran's service included within the text in citation format.
            4.) When referencing the condition's possible connection to the veterans service, utilize the phrase "at least as likely as not" to indicate the connection between the condition and the veteran's service.
            5.) Include the phrase "after a thorough review of his service treatment records and the Veterans Administration claims folder" to indicate that the connection is based on the evidence in the veterans file.
            6.) Utilize the following structure for the Nexus Letter:
            [Doctor's Letterhead]
            [Doctor's Name]
            [Doctor's Specialty]
            [Doctor's Address]

            [Phone Number]

            Hello,
   
            [Action: Fully written and Complete Letter Body that includes supporting statements that include the 2 supporting scientific studies provided by the BrowsingAgent in citation format.]
            
            Sincerely,
   
            [Doctor's Signature]
            [Doctor's Name]
            [License Number]
            [Specialty and Qualifications]
   
            [Space for Doctor's Signature]
   
            [References to the 2 supporting scientific studies provided by the BrowsingAgent in citation format.]
            
            Use the following tone and style criteria:
            Use straightforward language that feels like it is coming from a medical professional.
            Do not include any of the information from the examples in the Nexus Letter you are writing. 
            It should be written in a format that meets the requirements of the length and the content that is required for a Nexus Letter incorporating the information that you have been provided by the BrowsingAgent.
            Avoid any aspects that would make it seem written by ChatGPT.
            Do not include any of the information from the examples in the Nexus Letter you are writing. (e.g. sample-nexus-letter*.*)
            
            Content:
            Focus on specific information for 1 single condition unless otherwise requested.
            Do not mention other claims other than for the condition the service member is writing the NexusLetter specifically for.
            Ensure all content in the statement aligns with the 38 CFR Part 4 but never mention the 38CFR.
            Prioritize information that will provide the most accurate rating for the veteran.
            For any statements regarding back or neck conditions, include any information regarding nerve damage, radiculopathy, or any other symptoms that are related to the condition in the upper or lower extremities.
   
            Most importantly, the veteran's name has been excluded from the information provided to you so you will not be able to include the veteran's name in the Nexus Letter and you will replace the veteran's name with "[Service Member's Name]" within the NexusLetter.
   
            Final Rule:
            No Final Drafts should be delivered to the CEO until the letter is fully written with a complete and detailed letterbody and the references to the 2 supporting scientific studies provided by the BrowsingAgent in citation format.
            
            Write the NexusLetter into the /Shared_Documents folder with the FileWritingTool. Provide the full path to anyone who needs to read it. The naming convention for the files should be:
             1.) For a primary condition: 'Nexus Letter [condition] Final Draft.txt
             2.) For a secondary condition: 'Nexus Letter [condition a] due to [condition b] Final Draft.txt
